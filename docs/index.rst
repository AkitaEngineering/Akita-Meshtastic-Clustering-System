Welcome to the Akita Meshtastic Clustering System (AMCS) Documentation!
=======================================================================

AMCS enhances standard Meshtastic networks by introducing dynamic clustering,
reliable message queuing, and intelligent rebroadcasting to improve message
delivery reliability, network robustness, and power efficiency.

.. warning::
   This system requires **verification of Meshtastic API calls** against your
   specific ``meshtastic-python`` library version and **thorough testing on hardware**
   before deployment in a production environment. The Neighbor Synchronization
   feature is a framework and requires robust testing and potential refinement.
